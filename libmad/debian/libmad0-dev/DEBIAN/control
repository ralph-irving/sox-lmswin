Description: MPEG audio decoder development library
 MAD is an MPEG audio decoder. It currently only supports the MPEG 1
 standard, but fully implements all three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II,
 and Layer III, the latter often colloquially known as MP3.)
 .
 This is the package you need to develop or compile applications that use MAD.
